# 1MB_Drag_Force

Drag force
When a flow goes around a body, or a body goes through a fluid (gas or liquid), 
the fluid has to move to the sides to let the body to pass through. 
The energy lost on moving the fluid is translated to a force, called drag force

In Mechanical Engineering, we prefer to work with dimensionless parameters, 
i.e. instead of a drag force in Newtons on a specific body of a specific size, 
e.g. a 3 m long car, we would like to know what is the drag force on a 1:250 model of this car 
and then translate the knowledge to a full size car.
